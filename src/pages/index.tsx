// TODO: Home page: show option to add new question and show question categories that are also ready there
// TODO: Home Page (See a beautiful collage of all the questions you have), Add Friend, Profile Page, Questions Page (see your questions but also have the button for the Social Media)
// TODO: Social Media Aspect where people can anonymously post questions and people can upvote questions. A lot of upvotes adds a lot of heat to the question. Downvote questions to see bad questions to ask. User gets points for upvoted questions and gets rankings. Maybe have a reason for the question to be asked and have the option for people to put comments and or click little options on the questions card to show why it was upvoted or downvoted.
// NOTE: Commenting might be too get expensive so maybe just have the upvote, downvote, and reasoning buttons to press.
